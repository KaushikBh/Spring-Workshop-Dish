= Lab 2: Spring Boot Actuator

== part 1: Pick up where we left off
. navigate to your project from lab 1
. alternatively, you can go to start.spring.io and
.. go through all the steps from lab 1
.. when you specify dependencies, add 'actuator'
. assuming, you don't want to repeat yourself, open the pom.xml from lab 1
. add the following 2 dependencies
+
....
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.hateoas</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-hateoas</artifactId>
</dependency>

....
. spring-boot-starter-actuator is the guts of all the actuator endpoints
. spring-hateoas:
.. HATEOAS = Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State
.. provides functionality for the /actuator endpoint to allow it to point to all the other endpoints
.. if you remove the hateoas dependency, actuator still works, you just don't get the /actuator endpoint itself

== part 2: run locally and explore
. stop your previous version if it is still running
. `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
. visit http://localhost:8080/actuator
. follow the various links
. if you don't have the _JSONView_ chrome extension or something similar, consider installing it
. there is some documentation of the endpoints http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html[here]

== part 3:  cf push

. repackage `./mvnw clean package`
. push your app:  `cf push`
.. visit http://hello-your-random.yoursite.com/actuator
.. note some of the differences from your local version
. start thinking about lunch
